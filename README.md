## Why Vi-v ?

    I have seen how difficult it's for people to get into their projects.
    So I've tried to find a solution to help anybody to develop great software.
    
    Vi-v is this solution I've found.
    I can say Vi-v is my baby that help you to make your baby !
    
    As the main project of my company Nocturlab, I want to allow everyone to create and contribute to the open-source world. Because I think FLOSS software was the future of today. And to make that future a reality, I need to allow everyone who has ideas to be able to make them real.
